* Description *
***************  

This package includes a Matlab implementation of an algorithm used to detect image forgery by locating grid alignment abnormalities in JPEG compressed image bitmaps. Multiple grid positions are investigated to maximize a fitting function and areas of lower contribution are recognized as grid discontinuities and possibly tampered areas. An image segmentation step is introduced to differentiate between discontinuities produced by tampering and those that are attributed to image content.
